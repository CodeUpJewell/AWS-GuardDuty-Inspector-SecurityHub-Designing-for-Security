# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

** Based on the GuardDuty documentation below, detects these attack from VPC Flow Logs.


**An EC2 instance has been involved in SSH brute force attacks.

Default severity: Low*
Note

This finding's severity is low if a brute force attack is aimed at one of your EC2 instances. This finding's severity is high if your EC2 instance is being used to perform the brute force attack.

    Data source: VPC Flow Logs

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources.
