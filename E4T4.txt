# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

**Either remove the public facing ipv4 or specify SSH for certain approved IP addressess.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

**No VPC endpoints would not stop unauthorized access to the secret.txt if the IAM permissions are still insecure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

**No, applying default encryption will not encrypt all the existing files. You would need to go back and encrypt those files and then delete the older ones for security reason.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

**The same code would be invoked, and all the security risks that were identified will again come back in the setup.
