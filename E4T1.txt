** Right now anyone can SSH in on port 22. We should remediate by specifying  certain IP addresses for port 22.

**The EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address. We should release the elastic IP as soon as possible.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

**We should use the principal of least privilege(PoLP), enable SSE for the S3 bucket, and have more strict policy inacted. This allow makes it so only the nessecary actions are allowed.
